 My C++ Project. Feel free to contribute. I am just practicing here
## Take a look at the issues:) #Hacktoberfest
List of files:
 1. YouAreYoung.cpp (works)
 2. CircleSquare.cpp (Works perfectly)
 3. BoxerWorld.cpp (off-topic project, to be developed)
 4. CaseFunction1.cpp (not working properly; Homework if24-if27 about cases)
 5. CaseFunction2.cpp (works, but with __IF__ instead of __SWITCH__)
 6. cycles.cxx (shows how cycles work)
 7. intmax.cpp (to be continued, works)
 8. ln(x+1)-func.cpp (evaluates logarithm, works)
 9. stairycycle.cpp (works, shows how cycles work)
 10. BubbleSortt.cpp (sorting algorythm from class, works)
 11. max-ind-array.cpp (array operation with max and ind, works)
 12. maxsum.cpp (array maxsum operations, works)
 13. del_element_matrix_Original (works, hometask in the end)
 14. del_element_matrix(undone)
 15. file.cpp (works, don't know what it does-from lesson whiteboard)
 16. matrice_special_el.cpp (works)
 17. pair_numbers.cpp (review required)
 18. special_matrice_elements.cpp (review required)
 19. delete_row.cpp (___#TODO___ returns max element, does not count sum of line of the matrix, does not delete line with lowest sum of elements from the matrix)
